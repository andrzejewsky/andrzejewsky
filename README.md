##### ðŸ’¡ About me
I'm a software engineer with 10+ years of experience and a tech leader/engineering manager. I love to build tech products and lead teams towards achieving defined goals.

On daily basis, I try to deliver the best engineering solutions I can, making product I work on a better place. Besides coding, I care about entire process of it, including building CI/CD pipelines, proper quality assurance, quality of the code and even reasoning of why we build something (product-wise). 

I develop myself also in the area of engineering management, thus I lead teams guiding them through their motivation, awareness of the product, and overall satisfaction. 


##### ðŸ’» Specialisation
Everything related to Typescript, including AWS or overall architecture. I'm able to code in any programming language if that is needed and solve the problem. Apart from programming, I lead and mentor teams acting as engineering manager.
